### Design 
#### Framework
* **Bootstrap**, front-end framework is chosen for this project for its modern interface, ease of use and ability to be easily customized. It is used for creating features such as navbar, cards, forms, modals, as well as for the layout.
* **JQuery** is used for initializing some Bootstrap components, as well as for custom functions, DOM manipulation
#### Colour Scheme
I used warm bright colours to go with the company logo.You can see the colours [here](https://github.com/Taitdanielle/TheNailHutt/blob/main/wireframes/colour-palet.png)
#### Typography 
The typefaces I used across the project are:
* [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand) I have used for the paragraphs, I really like this font as it goes well with the business logo and it is also easy to read.
* [Amatic SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Amatic+SC?preview.text=Products&preview.text_type=custom) I have used this for the page titles as it works well with the current theme and other typefaces.
I think both typfaces work well with the style and colours of the website. 
#### Icons
Icons are used all over the web, They are good at grabbing a users attention. They help users find content quickly and easily. Another advantage of useing them is breaking language barriers too! They create more user-friendly experience by giving the visual clue of the subject.
* I used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) as the main icon library for social media links, forms, cart, user icons in the navigation.
* I also used some iscons that were found in a free iscon library called [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) used in the party and landing pages.
### Wireframes
Balsamiq wireframes tool was used to create all wireframes for this project. I really enjoy using this tool.
You can find the wireframes for this website [here](https://github.com/Taitdanielle/TheNailHutt/tree/main/wireframes).
### Features
The Nail Hutt is composed by applications: `Landing`, `Partys`, `Products`(Products & Services), `Shopping Cart`, `Checkout` and `Profiles`.
### Existing Features
#### **NavBar**
The navbar is fixed at the top of the page at all times, This allows a user to easisly navigate through the website. The name The Nail Hutt is located at the top lefthand corner on a desktop and in the center on smaller devices. It redirects a user to the home/landing page when clicked. On smalled screens such as tablet and mobile the navbar is collapsed into a burger icon. Menu links appear when the burger icon is clicked and will collapse back when clicked again or off the page. 
Navbar also contains a shopping cart icon, with a grand total displated if there are items in the cart added. It changes colour to blue when there in somthing in the cart to catch the users attention, and remains purple when the cart is empty. Clicking on the cart redirects a user to the shopping cart page.
The Navbar links change if you are a logged in or non logged in users. 
* for non logged in users the nav bar will show login/register links.

#### **Products Page**
* The "All products" page displays product cards, including the following information: category, name, price. All product cards are clickable and redirect a user to the individual product page with detailed information (by clicking on the image or the "View details" button).
* Clicking on Add to cart button will add the product to the cart with quantity equal to 1, clicking again will simply updates the quantity by 1. This functionality was added to enhance user experiance, to allow users straight away add an item to the cart without viewing products details and giving more flexibility to use the website.
* If the user is admin, there are also 2 buttons displayed in the cards: Edit and Delete. Clicking Edit button redirects admin to the Edit Product page. Delete button toggles the Delete modal. It asks a superuser to confirm if the product is to be deleted. If so, upon clicking "Delete" button, the product will not be removed from the database, but will set as discontinued and will be removed from the user's view. Then the page reloads and the toast-message will inform about the sucessfull deletion. There is also a button "Cancel" that closes the modal when it's clicked. These actions can be done only by superuser, attempts to access them by other users will end up with redirection to the landing page with toast error messages displayed.

* There's also an optional Comment field for cases if a user has any additional comments to the order.
* A user is informed how much the card will be charged in the paragraph below the Proceed to payment button.
* Since the website is made for educational purposes only and the Stripe functionality is only for testing, only 4242 4242 4242 4242 card number will lead to the successfull payment. A user is asked to provide card number, expiration date (any date in future) and CVC (any numbers).
* A webhook is used to make sure that the order is processed even in the cases when the payment process is interrupted (e.g. if a user accidentally closes the page or browser after clicking "Proceed to payment" button).
* Once the form is submitted and the payment is successfully proceeded, the Checkout sucesss page is loaded and a confirmation email is sent to the user's email. Also, a toast message appears to ensure the user that the order was processed successfully.
#### **Checkout success Page**
* The paragraph with a Thank you message is displayed on the top of the page to inform a user that the payment was processed and the email was sent to the user's email.
* The 3 sections Order info, Shipping details and Order Summary contain all the information about the completed order.

Contact page consists of 2 sections:

Contact form that's offered to fill out (name, email, message) if a user has any questions or queries. The real email will be sent to the admin of the website (handling by django send_mail() functionality). If an authenticated user opens the contact page, the full name (if provided in user's profile) and email fields are pre-populated.
Contact details section provides company's address, phone number and email, along with a map showing the location of The Nail Hutt. By clicking at the red marker, a user can check the opening hours. Google Map API was used to accomplish that.
### **Admin Product Management**
Product managment feature is available only for a superuser. The Admin page allows an owner of the website to add new products/services by filling out one of the two forms - Add New Product and Add New Service on the Product Management page. If the form is valid, the product/service is added to the database and the user is redirected to the new created product/service details page. The defensive design is implemented to restrict other than admin users to manually enter the url to get access to the page. User will be redirected to the home page with the toast error messages appeared. Edit and Delete product/service functionality allow an admin to make the corresponding manipulations. The Delete functionality was updated during the development, so the product/service is not being completely removed from the database, but set as discontinued and is hidden from the user's view and can be set as active again any time.
### **Django-allauth features**
**Sign Up**
The sign up page allows a user to create a new account. The user is asked to fill the fields "email", "username", "password" and "password (again)". When adding a username, the code compares it against existing email to ensure that it is unique. If user's input does not meet requirements, flash messages will inform a user about the error. When the form is submitted, a verification email is sent to the user's email to verify the email and finish registration process.
There is also a link to the login page for existing users at the bottom of the form.
The Registration page is only available to anonymous users and logged-in users are redirected out automatically.

**Login**
The login page features the form with "username" and "password" fields, allowing registered users to log into their account. If the login was successfull, a user is redirected to the home page and the toast success message appears informing that the log in was successful. Otherwise, flash messages will be displayed about incorrect user's input.
There is also a link to the sign up page for new users at the bottom of the form. As well as that, there's a link to the forgot password functionality, using which a user can reset their password. The login page is only available to anonymous users and logged-in users are redirected out automatically.

**Forgot password**
A user can reset their password to be able to login by entering the email. Then the link for reseting password will be sent to the email provided. The user can create a new password and then login with a new password.

**Logout**
Hitting "logout" button renders logout page, asking to confirm if a user wants to logout. It will end their session and redirects to the homepage with a toast success message appeared.

**404 and 500 error pages**
Custom 404 and 500 pages contain heading, short information about the error and a button "Back Home". As well as that, they display navbar that allows users to come back easily to any page if they got lost.

## Information Architecture
#### Database Choice
During the development phase I worked with sqlite3 database which is installed with Django.
For deployment(production), a PostgreSQL database is provided by Heroku as an add-on.

The User model used in this project is provided by Django as a part of defaults django.contrib.auth.models. More information about Django’s authentication system can be found here.
